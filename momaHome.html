					<h1><a href="pages/mbma/venerean-landscape.html">VENEREAN LANDSCAPE</a></h1>
					<h2>22 October 2015</h2>
					<br>
					<img src="images/mbma/Venerean Landscape.jpg" onload="setGoodHeight(this);">
					<p>The name of this work is inspired by its intense warmth. Comprable, perhaps, to the surface of the planet Venus, only with less noxious gas. Like the planet venus, as Venerean Landscape ascends from the bottom, rises in altitude, it becomes less intense and more calming, to match Venus's upper atmosphere and general exterior appearance. Perhaps it is an utterly hellish place, but at least from our point of view, Venus is indeed a truly beautiful planet.</p>

					<h1><a href="pages/rma/mega-ripple-wave.html">MEGA RIPPLE WAVE</a></h1>
					<h2>19 November 2015</h2> 
					<br>
					<img src="images/rma/Mega Ripple Wave.jpg" onload="setGoodHeight(this);">
					<p>Some sort of wave travels along, and as it reaches the center of this work it expands and reaches a sort of explosion, from which it departs in a marvelous array of colors. It is abstraction incarnate - what this picture really displays is impossible to understand, but it begs to be examined and reexamined, and admired for its beauty, its incomprehensibility.</p>

					<h1><a href="pages/vpma/chalice-of-the-universe.html">CHALICE OF THE UNIVERSE</a></h1>
					<h2>23 September 2015</h2> 
					<br>
					<img src="images/vpma/Chalice of the Universe.jpg" onload="setGoodHeight(this);">
					<p>Like the universe, the chalice is only transient. In fact, it doesn't even look like a chalice - perhaps this picture is misnamed. It invites interpretation. The pastel fade from soft yellow to baby blue may represent harmony, and the rough moire in the center of the work is somehow lyrical. Chalice is not a literal title, for it is just an abstraction. The essence of modern art.</p>

					<h2>22 May 2015</h2> 
					<br>
					<img src="images/oma/Deep Pond.jpg" onload="setGoodHeight(this);">
					<p>Why are ponds green? I dunno. But then, sometimes you just have to jump in, and maybe it'll make sense. This was the first work in the Monitors of Modern Art library, and is a very strong start. It is a beautiful, yet simple, metaphor.</p>
