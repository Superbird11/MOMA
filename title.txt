CPMA is a very different presentation from the past couple of collections. These works are vibrant, colorful, active, and filled with pastel gradient. <a href="pages/cpma/sun-warmed-sand.html">Sun-Warmed Sand</a> is a good example, being an intensely warm work focused on yellow, with a geometric blue highlight towards the edge. <a href="pages/cpma/the-first-life.html">The First Life</a> is another example, being more blue/green in general nature and having better shading and transitions between colors. However, bright pastel gradient isn't all this collection has to offer. <a href="pages/cpma/rushing-blood.html">Rushing Blood</a> presents a perfect color contrast between light blue and deep red, with less pastel in its shading and a very different feel. <a href="pages/cpma/really-deep-down.html">Really Deep Down</a> is perhaps the most unique work in this collection, mostly due to its color composition. A deep, slightly unsaturated purple stands out among the rest of MOMA's primary- and secondary-color-focused works. A teal color acts in the work as a bridge between the purple and a slightly dim orange, to provoke a fascinating and truly unique atmosphere. And finally, my personal favorite work in CPMA is <a href="pages/cpma/sun-in-the-lagoon.html">Sun in the Lagoon</a>, which provides the clearest design in this gallery, all while being one of the most colorful and one of the most well-balanced works. The rest of this gallery, especially, is also very much worth checking out, so please enjoy!
